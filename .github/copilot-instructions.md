# AI Agent Instructions for git_github_test

## Project Overview
This is a simple Python project that appears to be in its initial stages. The project currently consists of a minimal structure with basic Python and text files.

## Repository Structure
```
.
├── main.py      # Main Python script (currently contains minimal code)
└── text.txt     # Text file with test content
```

## Development Environment
- Language: Python
- Version Control: Git
- Repository: git_github_test (Owner: blenderneon-coder)
- Branch: master

## Current State
The project is in a very early stage with minimal implementation. The main Python file (`main.py`) contains only a basic print statement, and `text.txt` contains some test text content.

## Project Conventions
As the project is in its early stages, specific conventions and patterns are yet to be established. Future updates to these instructions should document:
- Code style and formatting standards
- Testing approaches
- Build and deployment processes
- Project-specific patterns and practices

## Next Steps
Consider adding:
1. A proper Python project structure
2. Requirements or dependency management
3. Testing framework
4. Documentation standards
5. CI/CD configuration

*Note: These instructions will need to be updated as the project evolves and more complex patterns and workflows emerge.*
